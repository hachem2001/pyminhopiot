## CHANNEL

- Channels treat the transmission. As of now, they don't do collisions of packets. To be improved.
- In case of collisions : packets should have this information appended to them in a way when received by a node : a "mushed" signal, or something.

## LPWAN_JITTER

Concerning LPWAN Jitter, some "conventions" :
- Source IDs go 1, 2, 3, ...
- Any gateway has the ID 0
- Relays don't spontenously send transmissions => no assigned source ID.
